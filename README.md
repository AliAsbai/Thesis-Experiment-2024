# Thesis Experiment 2024

*This repository was created as part of a thesis experiment conducted during the spring of 2024. The final thesis can be read by using this [link]().*

This repository contains the final code generated for each assignment by both ChatGPT and Gemini both utilizing RAG and not utilizing it. The structure of the repository is as follows. The root of the repository consists of 100 folders for each of the 100 assignments that were attempted during the experiment. Inside each folder, there are another two folders representing ChatGPT and Gemini, respectively. These folders contain two Python code files named after the method that was used to generate them (utilizing RAG and not utilizing it). The assignments can all be found on [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/).
